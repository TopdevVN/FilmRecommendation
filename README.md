Basic Web App Movie Recommendation using the Streamlit Library.

Here is a short summary of this project:
This project aims to create a basic web app to demo a movie recommendation system that can suggest similar movies for you.

**First**, I scrape the data from rottentomatoes.com, then do some preprocessing steps, and I have the cleaned data.

**Next**, I build a machine learning model using content-based filtering.

**Finally**, I use the streamlit library to deploy my model with a basic website.
