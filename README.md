Basic Web App Movie Recommendation using the Streamlit Library
Here is a short summary of this project:
This project aims to create a basic web app to demo a movie recommendation system that can suggest similar movies for you.
First, I will crawl the data from rottentomatoes.com, then do some preprocessing steps, and I'll have the cleaned data.
Next, I will build a machine learning model using content-based filtering.
Finally, I use the streamlit library to deploy my ML model.
